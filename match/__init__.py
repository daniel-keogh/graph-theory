"""
This package allows you to check if a regular expression matches a given
string of text, using an algorithm known as Thompsonâ€™s construction.

Thompson's construction is a method of transforming a regular expression into
a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA), a way of describing sets of
character strings. Every valid regular expression will have an equivalant NFA
that matches the same set of strings.

In short, the algorithm works by composing small NFA fragments that 
represent part of the regular expression, and then building larger NFAs from
those smaller NFA fragments, with a different construction for each operator.

Thompson's construction offers a significant performance boost over other
traditional backtracking approaches to regular expression matching
(i.e. those used in programming languages like Perl). Such backtracking
algorithms keep track of only one transition at a time, and backtrack
to another path if the current path fails. Thompson's algorithm meanwhile,
tracks all possible state transitions simultaneously.
