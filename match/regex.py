"""
This module provides functions for compiling a regular expression into an
NFA and checking if that NFA matches a given search string.

Supported Operators
===================
    This operators supported by this module are outlined below:

    * ``.`` - Concatenation. Note that this character denotes *explicit*
        concatenation. (e.g. The regular expression "h.e.l.l.o" is required
        in order to match the string "hello").

    * ``|`` - The OR operator represents alternation/union.

    * ``?`` - Indicates an optional character (zero or one occurrences).

    * ``+`` - The plus symbol indicates one or more occurrences of the
        preceding character.

    * ``*`` - The Kleene star indicates zero or more occurrences of the
        preceding character.
