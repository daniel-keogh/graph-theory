"""This module provides functions for compiling a regular expression into an
NFA and checking if that NFA matches a given search string.

**Supported Operators**:
    This module supports a limited number of operators, outlined below:

    * ``.`` - Concatenation. Note that this character denotes *explicit*
        concatenation. (e.g. The regex "h.e.l.l.o" is required to match
        the string "hello").

    * ``|`` - The OR operator.

    * ``?`` - Indicates an optional character (zero or one occurrences).

    * Repetitions:
        * ``+`` - The plus symbol indicates one or more occurrences of the
            preceding character.
        * ``*`` - The Kleene star indicates zero or more occurrences of the
            preceding character.

    Unfortunately it is not yet possible to "escape" any of these characters
    in order to match the literal equivalent.
