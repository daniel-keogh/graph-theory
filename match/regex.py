"""
This module provides functions for compiling a regular expression into an
NFA and checking if that NFA matches a given search string.

Supported Operators
===================
    The operators supported by this module are outlined below:

    * ``.`` - Concatenation. Note that this operator denotes *explicit*
        concatenation. (e.g. The regular expression "h.e.l.l.o" is required
        in order to match the string "hello").

    * ``|`` - The OR operator represents alternation/union.

    * ``?`` - Indicates an optional character (zero or one occurrences).

    * ``+`` - The plus symbol indicates one or more occurrences of the
        preceding character.

    * ``*`` - The "Kleene star" indicates zero or more occurrences of the
        preceding character.

def compile_regex(regex: str) -> Fragment:
    """
    Compiles a given regular expression (in infix notation) to a NFA
    Fragment and returns it. 

    The compilation process works by first converting `regex` to postfix
    notation and then scanning through the postfix expression, whilst
    maintaining a stack of computed NFA fragments. When a literal character is
    read, a new NFA fragment is pushed onto the stack. Operators meanwhile pop
    fragments off the stack (one fragment for unary operators & two for binary
    operators) and then push a new fragment representing the result of the
    operation. At the end, a single NFA fragment remains which represents the
    compiled regular expression.
